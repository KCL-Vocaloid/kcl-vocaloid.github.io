Website for KCL Vocaloid Society. 
Founded in 2024, King's College London Vocaloid Society (KCLVS) is a student-led university organisation focused on Vocaloid culture, the first of its kind in London. Our mission is to build a community for all university-aged enthusiasts of vocal synthesis technology along with its spin-off subculture, as well as academics and producers in the field.
